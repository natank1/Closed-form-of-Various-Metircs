# Closed-form-of-Various-Metircs

This tiny branch is a set of closed form metrics that Iprogrmamed using pytorch since I did nt have them for my own research

What does it include?
We have a KL  Divergence file for Gaussians :
Unitvariate Gaussian -clear

We have several functions for multivariate Gaussians.
Two distirbutions each of them consists of a regular vector of means and covaraince matrix 
One distirubtion (mean and covariance ) which is compared to the stnadrard Normal dist
Two Gaussians where the covariance matrices are vectors (namely we assume the covariance matrices are diaonal)
The same with Gaussian


Wassertein2
We compare two Gaussians according to Wasserstein2 with the four options as in KL divergence

Dirichlet/Beta
Implmenting the closed form of Dirichlet distribution
For vectors with length two it is simply beta


Gamma
Say no more
